\usage{
create_figures_doc(
  resdir = NULL,
  subdir = NULL,
  include_all = TRUE,
  rda_dir = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{resdir}{Filepath of the directory storing the model
results file(s). Examples where dover_sole_2024 is the project root
for absolute and relative filepaths, respectively:
"C:/Users/patrick.star/Documents/dover_sole_2024/models",
"here::here("models")".}

\item{subdir}{Location of subdirectory storing the assessment report template}

\item{include_all}{TRUE/FALSE; Option to include all default
figures for a stock assessment report. Default is true.}

\item{rda_dir}{If the user has already created .rda files containing
figures, tables, alt text, and captions with \code{satf}, rda_dir represents
the location of the folder containing these .rda files ("rda_files").
Otherwise, if the user has not used \code{satf} to make those .rda files already,
those files will be generated automatically and placed within the "report"
folder within the \code{file_dir}. The "rda_files" folder would have been
made with \code{satf::exp_all_figs_tables()}, or by exporting files by running individual
\code{satf} figure- and table-generating functions. If you have used \code{satf} to
generate these .rda files, you can leave the arguments below blank. NOTE:
If an "rda_files" folder is detected within rda_dir, .rda files will not be
regenerated.}
}
\value{
A quarto document with pre-loaded R chunk that adds the
stock assessment tables from the nmfs-ost/satf R package. The
quarto document will become part of the stock assessment outline.
