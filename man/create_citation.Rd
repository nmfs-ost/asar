\usage{
create_citation(
  author = NULL,
  title = "[TITLE]",
  year = format(as.POSIXct(Sys.Date(), format = "\%YYYY-\%mm-\%dd"), "\%Y")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{author}{A character vector of author names with their accompanying
affiliations. For example, a Jane Doe at the NWFSC Seattle, Washington office
would have an entry of c("Jane Doe"="NWFSC-SWA"). Information on NOAA offices
is found in a database located in the package: \code{system.file("resources", 
"affiliation_info.csv", package = "asar")}. Keys to the office addresses
follow the naming convention of the office acronym (ex. NWFSC) with a dash
followed by the first initial of the city then the 2 letter abbreviation for
the state the office is located in. If the city has 2 or more words such as
Panama City, the first initial of each word is used in the key
(ex. Panama City, Florida = PCFL)}

\item{title}{A custom title that is an alternative to the default title (composed
in asar::create_title()). Example: "Management Track Assessments Spring 2024".}

\item{year}{Year the assessment is being conducted. Default
is the year in which the report is rendered.}
