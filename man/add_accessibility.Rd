\title{Add Accessibility to .tex documents}
\usage{
add_accessibility(
  x = list.files(getwd())[grep("skeleton.tex", list.files(getwd()))],
  dir = getwd(),
  figures_dir = getwd(),
  alttext_csv_dir = getwd(),
  compile = TRUE,
  rename = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{.tex file containing report. Typically produced after initially
rendering the skeleton made from create_template.}

\item{dir}{directory where the tex file is located that will be edited}

\item{figures_dir}{The location of the "figures" folder, which contains
figures files.}

\item{alttext_csv_dir}{Directory for the csv file containing alternative
text and captions generated when running stockplotr::exp_all_figs_tables}

\item{compile}{Indicate whether the document (X) should be
rendered after these files are changed. Default TRUE.}

\item{rename}{Indicate a name for the new tex file produced from this
function. There is no need to include ".tex" in the name. Defaults to current
name and overwrites the current tex file.}

\item{tagged}{Indicate if the input tex file from dir has the latex package
\tagpdf used so that tagging is present.}
}
\value{
This function runs all functions from \code{asar} associated with
accessibility and renders the final document. The document is tagged and
includes alternative text from the captions_alt_text.csv produced from
\code{stockplotr} package also available on GitHub.
