\arguments{
\item{x}{.tex file to add accessibility into}

\item{dir}{directory where the tex file is located that will be edited}

\item{rda_dir}{folder where rda files containing alternative text is located}

\item{compile}{TRUE/FALSE - indicate whether the document (X) should be rendered after these files are changed}

\item{rename}{change the name of the latex file for final compilation or saving}
}
\value{
DRAFT: This function was made to help add in latex packages and content
associated with PDF tagging. Quarto does not allow the user to edit anything
before documentclass, so this function alters the rendered .tex file. Users
should either compile directly through the function or run
tinytex::lualatex(...) afterwards in the console.
