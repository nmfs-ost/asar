\arguments{
\item{rerender_skeleton}{Re-create the "skeleton.qmd" in your outline when
changes to the main skeleton need to be made. This reproduces the
yaml, output (if changed), preamble quantities, and restructures your
sectioning in the skeleton if indicated. All files in your folder
will remain as is.}

\item{office}{Regional Fisheries Science Center producing the
report (i.e., AFSC, NEFSC, NWFSC, PIFSC, SEFSC, SWFSC).}

\item{prev_skeleton}{Vector of strings containing all the lines of the
previous skeleton file. File is read in using the function readLines from
base R.}

\item{prev_format}{The format that the previous skeleton was directed to
render to. Parameter is inherited from create_template.}

\item{title}{A custom title that is an alternative to the default title (composed
in asar::create_title()). Example: "Management Track Assessments Spring 2024".}

\item{author_list}{A vector of strings containing pre-formatted author names
and affiliations that would be found in the format in a yaml of a quarto
file when using cat(author_list).}

\item{author}{Ordered list of authors included in the assessment.}

\item{add_author}{Author that is not currently in the database
and who should be temporarily added to the author list. Format
as "First MI Last".
Please leave a comment on the GitHub issues page to be added.}

\item{add_image}{TRUE/FALSE; Add image of species to the
template that is not already included in the project's
inst/resources/spp_img folder? Default is false.}

\item{spp_image}{File path to the species' image if not
using the image included in the project's repository.}

\item{species}{Full common name for target species. Split
naming with a space and capitalize first letter(s). Example:
"Dover sole".}

\item{spp_latin}{Latin name for the target species. Example:
"Pomatomus saltatrix".}

\item{region}{Full name of region in which the species is
evaluated (if applicable). If the region is not specified for
your center or species, do not use this variable.}

\item{format}{Rendering format (pdf, html, or docx).}

\item{parameters}{TRUE/FALSE; For
parameterization of the script. Default is true.}

\item{param_names}{List of parameter names that will be called
in the document. Parameters automatically included:
office, region, species (each of which are listed as
individual parameters for this function, above).}

\item{param_values}{List of values associated with the order
of parameter names. Parameters automatically included:
office, region, species (each of which are listed as
individual parameters for this function, above).}

\item{bib_name}{Name of a bib file being added into the yaml. For example,
"asar.bib".}

\item{bib_file}{File path to a .bib file used for citing references in
the report}

\item{year}{Year the assessment is being conducted. Default
is the year in which the report is rendered.}
