\arguments{
\item{format}{Rendering format (pdf, html, or docx).}

\item{office}{Regional Fisheries Science Center producing the
report (i.e., AFSC, NEFSC, NWFSC, PIFSC, SEFSC, SWFSC).}

\item{region}{Full name of region in which the species is
evaluated (if applicable). If the region is not specified for
your center or species, do not use this variable.}

\item{species}{Full common name for target species. Split
naming with a space and capitalize first letter(s). Example:
"Dover sole".}

\item{spp_latin}{Latin name for the target species. Example:
"Pomatomus saltatrix".}

\item{spp_image}{File path to the species' image if not
using the image included in the project's repository.}

\item{year}{Year the assessment is being conducted. Default
is the year in which the report is rendered.}

\item{bib_name}{Name of a bib file being added into the yaml. For example,
"asar.bib".}

\item{bib_file}{File path to a .bib file used for citing references in
the report}

\item{author_list}{A list of strings containing pre-formatted author names
and affiliations that would be found in the format in a yaml of a quarto
file when using \code{cat(author_list[[i]])}.}

\item{title}{A custom title that is an alternative to the default title (composed
in asar::create_title()). Example: "Management Track Assessments Spring 2024".}

\item{rerender_skeleton}{Re-create the "skeleton.qmd" in your outline when
changes to the main skeleton need to be made. This reproduces the
yaml, output (if changed), preamble quantities, and restructures your
sectioning in the skeleton if indicated. All files in your folder
will remain as is.}

\item{prev_skeleton}{Vector of strings containing all the lines of the
previous skeleton file. File is read in using the function readLines from
base R.}

\item{prev_format}{The format that the previous skeleton was directed to
render to. Parameter is inherited from create_template.}

\item{parameters}{TRUE/FALSE; For
parameterization of the script. Default is true.}

\item{param_names}{List of parameter names that will be called
in the document. Parameters automatically included:
office, region, species (each of which are listed as
individual parameters for this function, above).}

\item{param_values}{List of values associated with the order
of parameter names. Parameters automatically included:
office, region, species (each of which are listed as
individual parameters for this function, above).}

\item{type}{Type of report to build. Default is SAR (NOAA Fisheries
Stock Assessment Report).}
