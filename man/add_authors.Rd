\title{Format authors for skeleton}
\usage{
add_authors(author, rerender_skeleton = FALSE, prev_skeleton = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{author}{A character vector of author names with their accompanying
affiliations. For example, a Jane Doe at the NWFSC Seattle, Washington office
would have an entry of c("Jane Doe"="NWFSC-SWA"). Information on NOAA offices
is found in a database located in the package: \code{system.file("resources",
"affiliation_info.csv", package = "asar")}. Keys to the office addresses
follow the naming convention of the office acronym (ex. NWFSC) with a dash
followed by the first initial of the city then the 2 letter abbreviation for
the state the office is located in. If the city has 2 or more words such as
Panama City, the first initial of each word is used in the key
(ex. Panama City, Florida = PCFL)}

\item{rerender_skeleton}{Re-create the "skeleton.qmd" in your outline when
changes to the main skeleton need to be made. This reproduces the
yaml, output (if changed), preamble quantities, and restructures your
sectioning in the skeleton if indicated. All files in your folder
will remain as is.}

\item{prev_skeleton}{A character vector of the previous skeleton file read in through \code{readLines()}}
}
\value{
A list of authors formatted for a yaml in quarto. Viewable by running the
return object inside of cat() for each part of the list.
