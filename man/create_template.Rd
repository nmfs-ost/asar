\arguments{
\item{new_template}{TRUE/FALSE; Create a new template? If true,
will pull the last saved stock assessment report skeleton.
Default is false.}

\item{format}{Rendering format (pdf, html, or docx).}

\item{office}{Regional Fisheries Science Center producing the
report (i.e., AFSC, NEFSC, NWFSC, PIFSC, SEFSC, SWFSC).}

\item{region}{Full name of region in which the species is
evaluated (if applicable). If the region is not specified for
your center or species, do not use this variable.}

\item{complex}{TRUE/FALSE; Is this a species complex? Default
is false.}

\item{species}{Full common name for target species. Split
naming with a space and capitalize first letter(s). Example:
"Dover sole".}

\item{spp_latin}{Latin name for the target species. Example:
"Pomatomus saltatrix".}

\item{year}{Year the assessment is being conducted. Default
is the year in which the report is rendered.}

\item{file_dir}{Location of stock assessment files produced
by this function. Default is the working directory.}

\item{author}{Ordered list of authors included in the assessment.}

\item{add_author}{Author that is not currently in the database
and who should be temporarily added to the author list. Format
as "First MI Last".
Please leave a comment on the GitHub issues page to be added.}

\item{include_affiliation}{TRUE/FALSE; Does the analyst want to
include the authors' affiliations in the document? Default is
false.}

\item{simple_affiliation}{TRUE/FALSE; If including affiliations,
should the office name function as the affiliation, rather
than the full address? Default is true.}

\item{alt_title}{TRUE/FALSE; Use a title that is not the
default title (i.e., an alternative title)? Default is false.}

\item{title}{The alternative title. Example:
"Management Track Assessments Spring 2024".}

\item{parameters}{TRUE/FALSE; For
parameterization of the script. Default is true.}

\item{param_names}{List of parameter names that will be called
in the document. Parameters automatically included:
office, region, species (each of which are listed as
individual parameters for this function, above).}

\item{param_values}{List of values associated with the order
of parameter names. Parameters automatically included:
office, region, species (each of which are listed as
individual parameters for this function, above).}

\item{convert_output}{TRUE/FALSE; Convert the output file to
standard model format while creating report template? Default
is false.}

\item{fleet_names}{Deprecated: List of fleet names as described in BAM output
file (abbreviations).}

\item{resdir}{Filepath of the directory storing the model
results file(s). Examples where dover_sole_2024 is the project root
for absolute and relative filepaths, respectively:
"C:/Users/patrick.star/Documents/dover_sole_2024/models",
"here::here("models")".}

\item{model_results}{The model results file. Before the stock
assessment output file has been converted to a standardized format
with the function convert_output.R, the model results file may be
a .sso or .rdata file. After conversion, this file will be a .csv file.}

\item{model}{Type of assessment model that was used to assess
the stock (e.g., "BAM", "SS3", "AMAK", "ASAP", etc.).}

\item{new_section}{Names of section(s) (e.g., introduction, results) or
subsection(s) (e.g., a section within the introduction) that will be
added to the document. Please make a short list if >1 section/subsection
will be added. The template will be created as a quarto document, added
into the skeleton, and saved for reference.}

\item{section_location}{Where new section(s)/subsection(s) will be added to
the skeleton template. Please use the notation of 'placement-section'.
For example, 'in-introduction' signifies that the new content would
be created as a child document and added into the 02_introduction.qmd.
To add >1 (sub)section, make the location a list corresponding to the
order of (sub)section names listed in the 'new_section' parameter.}

\item{type}{Type of report to build. Default is SAR.}

\item{prev_year}{Year in which the previous assessment report
was conducted. Used to pull previous assessment template.}

\item{custom}{TRUE/FALSE; Build custom sectioning for the
template, rather than the default for stock assessments in
your region? Default is false.}

\item{custom_sections}{List of existing sections to include in
the custom template. Note: this only includes sections within
list.files(system.file("templates", "skeleton",
package = "asar")). The name of the section, rather than the
name of the file, can be used (e.g., 'abstract' rather than
'00_abstract.qmd'). If adding a new section, also use
parameters 'new_section' and 'section_location'.}

\item{include_figures}{TRUE/FALSE; Should figures be
included in the report? Default is true.}

\item{include_tables}{TRUE/FALSE; Should tables be included
in the report? Default is true.}

\item{add_image}{TRUE/FALSE; Add image of species to the
template that is not already included in the project's
inst/resources/spp_img folder? Default is false.}

\item{spp_image}{File path to the species' image if not
using the image included in the project's repository.}

\item{bib_file}{File path to a .bib file used for citing references in
the report}

\item{rda_dir}{The location of the folder containing .rda files
("rda_files") already made with \code{satf}, or, if the user has not used
\code{satf} to make those .rda files already, rda_dir represents the location
that will contain .rda files in an "rda_files" folder. The folder would have
been made with \code{satf::exp_all_figs_tables()}, or by exporting files
by running individual \code{satf} figure- and table-generating functions.
If you have used \code{satf} to generate these .rda files, you can leave
the arguments below blank.}

\item{unit_label}{units for recruitment}

\item{scale_amount}{indicate the exact amount of scale (i.e. 1000)}

\item{end_year}{last year of assessment}

\item{n_projected_years}{Number of years spawning biomass is projected for.
By default this number is set to 10}

\item{relative}{A logical value specifying if the resulting figures should
be relative spawning biomass. The default is `FALSE`. `ref_line` indicates
which reference point to use.}

\item{make_rda}{This argument is automatically assessed based on the presence
or absence of .rda files and should be left blank. TRUE/FALSE; indicate
whether to produce an .rda file containing a list with the figure/table,
caption, and alternative text (if figure) for each figure and table.}

\item{ref_line}{An argument inherited from \code{satf::plot_spawning_biomass.R}.
A string specifying the type of reference you want to
compare spawning biomass to. The default is \code{"target"}, which looks for
\code{"spawning_biomass_target"} in the \code{"label"} column of \code{dat}. The actual
searching in \code{dat} is case agnostic and will work with either upper- or
lower-case letters but you must use one of the options specified in the
default list to ensure that the label on the figure looks correct
regardless of how it is specified in \code{dat}.}

\item{spawning_biomass_label}{An argument inherited from
\code{satf::plot_spawn_recruitment.R}. Units for spawning biomass.}

\item{recruitment_label}{An argument inherited from
\code{satf::plot_spawn_recruitment.R}. Units for recruitment.}

\item{ref_line_sb}{An argument with inherited from \code{satf::plot_spawning_biomass.R}
(under the parameter name \code{ref_line}, changed slightly to differentiate from
the ref_line indicated for \code{satf::plot_biomass.}) A string specifying the type of
reference you want to compare spawning biomass to. The default is \code{"target"},
which looks for \code{"spawning_biomass_target"} in the \code{"label"} column of \code{dat}.
The actual searching in \code{dat} is case agnostic and will work with either upper- or
lower-case letters but you must use one of the options specified in the
default list to ensure that the label on the figure looks correct
regardless of how it is specified in \code{dat}.}

\value{
Create template and pull skeleton for a stock assessment report.
Function builds a YAML specific to the region and utilizes current
resources and workflows from different U.S. Fishery Science Centers.
General sections are called as child documents in this skeleton and
each of the child documents should be edited separately.

To see templates included in the base skeleton, please run
'list.files(system.file('templates','skeleton', package = 'asar'))'
in the console.
