\arguments{
\item{new_template}{TRUE/FALSE; Create a new template? If true,
will pull the last saved stock assessment report skeleton.
Default is false.}

\item{format}{Rendering format (pdf, html, or docx).}

\item{office}{Regional Fisheries Science Center producing the
report (i.e., AFSC, NEFSC, NWFSC, PIFSC, SEFSC, SWFSC).}

\item{species}{Full common name for target species. Split
naming with a space and capitalize first letter(s). Example:
"Dover sole".}

\item{spp_latin}{Latin name for the target species. Example:
"Pomatomus saltatrix".}

\item{year}{Year the assessment is being conducted. Default
is the year in which the report is rendered.}

\item{file_dir}{Location of stock assessment files produced
by this function. Default is the working directory.}

\item{author}{Ordered list of authors included in the assessment.}

\item{add_author}{Author that is not currently in the database
and who should be temporarily added to the author list. Format
as "First MI Last".
Please leave a comment on the GitHub issues page to be added.}

\item{region}{Full name of region in which the species is
evaluated (if applicable). If the region is not specified for
your center or species, do not use this variable.}

\item{include_affiliation}{TRUE/FALSE; Does the analyst want to
include the authors' affiliations in the document? Default is
false.}

\item{simple_affiliation}{TRUE/FALSE; If including affiliations,
should the office name function as the affiliation, rather
than the full address? Default is true.}

\item{title}{A custom title that is an alternative to the default title (composed
in asar::create_title()). Example: "Management Track Assessments Spring 2024".}

\item{parameters}{TRUE/FALSE; For
parameterization of the script. Default is true.}

\item{param_names}{List of parameter names that will be called
in the document. Parameters automatically included:
office, region, species (each of which are listed as
individual parameters for this function, above).}

\item{param_values}{List of values associated with the order
of parameter names. Parameters automatically included:
office, region, species (each of which are listed as
individual parameters for this function, above).}

\item{model_results}{The name of the object in your environment that contains the data frame of converted model output from \code{asar::convert_output()}}

\item{new_section}{Names of section(s) (e.g., introduction, results) or
subsection(s) (e.g., a section within the introduction) that will be
added to the document. Please make a short list if >1 section/subsection
will be added. The template will be created as a quarto document, added
into the skeleton, and saved for reference.}

\item{section_location}{Where new section(s)/subsection(s) will be added to
the skeleton template. Please use the notation of 'placement-section'.
For example, 'in-introduction' signifies that the new content would
be created as a child document and added into the 02_introduction.qmd.
To add >1 (sub)section, make the location a list corresponding to the
order of (sub)section names listed in the 'new_section' parameter.}

\item{type}{Type of report to build. Default is SAR.}

\item{custom}{TRUE/FALSE; Build custom sectioning for the
template, rather than the default for stock assessments in
your region? Default is false.}

\item{custom_sections}{List of existing sections to include in
the custom template. Note: this only includes sections within
list.files(system.file("templates", "skeleton",
package = "asar")). The name of the section, rather than the
name of the file, can be used (e.g., 'abstract' rather than
'00_abstract.qmd'). If adding a new section, also use
parameters 'new_section' and 'section_location'.}

\item{spp_image}{File path to the species' image if not
using the image included in the project's repository.}

\item{bib_file}{File path to a .bib file used for citing references in
the report}

\item{rerender_skeleton}{Re-create the "skeleton.qmd" in your outline when
changes to the main skeleton need to be made. This reproduces the
yaml, output (if changed), preamble quantities, and restructures your
sectioning in the skeleton if indicated. All files in your folder
will remain as is.}
}
\value{
Create template and pull skeleton for a stock assessment report.
Function builds a YAML specific to the region and utilizes current
resources and workflows from different U.S. Fishery Science Centers.
General sections are called as child documents in this skeleton and
each of the child documents should be edited separately.
}
\description{
To see templates included in the base skeleton, please run
'list.files(system.file('templates','skeleton', package = 'asar'))'
in the console.
