}
\arguments{
\item{format}{Rendering format (pdf, html, or docx).}

\item{type}{Type of report to build. Default is SAR (NOAA Fisheries
Stock Assessment Report).}

\item{office}{Regional Fisheries Science Center producing the
report (i.e., AFSC, NEFSC, NWFSC, PIFSC, SEFSC, SWFSC).}

\item{region}{Full name of region in which the species is
evaluated (if applicable). If the region is not specified for
your center or species, do not use this variable.}

\item{species}{Full common name for target species. Split
naming with a space and capitalize first letter(s). Example:
"Dover sole".}

\item{spp_latin}{Latin name for the target species. Example:
"Pomatomus saltatrix".}

\item{year}{Year the assessment is being conducted. Default
is the year in which the report is rendered.}

\item{author}{A character vector of author names with their accompanying
affiliations. For example, a Jane Doe at the NWFSC Seattle, Washington office
would have an entry of c("Jane Doe"="NWFSC-SWA"). Information on NOAA offices
is found in a database located in the package: \code{system.file("resources",
"affiliation_info.csv", package = "asar")}. Keys to the office addresses
follow the naming convention of the office acronym (ex. NWFSC) with a dash
followed by the first initial of the city then the 2 letter abbreviation for
the state the office is located in. If the city has 2 or more words such as
Panama City, the first initial of each word is used in the key
(ex. Panama City, Florida = PCFL)}

\item{file_dir}{Location of stock assessment files produced
by this function. Default is the working directory.}

\item{title}{A custom title that is an alternative to the default title (composed
in asar::create_title()). Example: "Management Track Assessments Spring 2024".}

\item{model_results}{The name of the object in your environment that contains the data frame of converted model output from \code{asar::convert_output()}}

\item{spp_image}{File path to the species' image if not
using the image included in the project's repository.}

\item{bib_file}{File path to a .bib file used for citing references in
the report}

\item{new_template}{TRUE/FALSE; Create a new template? If true,
will pull the last saved stock assessment report skeleton.
Default is false.}

\item{rerender_skeleton}{Re-create the "skeleton.qmd" in your outline when
changes to the main skeleton need to be made. This reproduces the
yaml, output (if changed), preamble quantities, and restructures your
sectioning in the skeleton if indicated. All files in your folder
will remain as is.}

\item{custom}{TRUE/FALSE; Build custom sectioning for the
template, rather than the default for stock assessments in
your region? Default is false.}

\item{custom_sections}{List of existing sections to include in
the custom template. Note: this only includes sections within
list.files(system.file("templates", "skeleton",
package = "asar")). The name of the section, rather than the
name of the file, can be used (e.g., 'abstract' rather than
'00_abstract.qmd'). If adding a new section, also use
parameters 'new_section' and 'section_location'.}

\item{new_section}{Names of section(s) (e.g., introduction, results) or
subsection(s) (e.g., a section within the introduction) that will be
added to the document. Please make a short list if >1 section/subsection
will be added. The template will be created as a quarto document, added
into the skeleton, and saved for reference.}

\item{section_location}{Where new section(s)/subsection(s) will be added to
the skeleton template. Please use the notation of 'placement-section'.
For example, 'in-introduction' signifies that the new content would
be created as a child document and added into the 02_introduction.qmd.
To add >1 (sub)section, make the location a list corresponding to the
order of (sub)section names listed in the 'new_section' parameter.}

\item{parameters}{TRUE/FALSE; For
parameterization of the script. Default is true.}

\item{param_names}{List of parameter names that will be called
in the document. Parameters automatically included:
office, region, species (each of which are listed as
individual parameters for this function, above).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed into functions used in create_template
such as \code{create_citation()}, \code{format_quarto()}, \code{add_chunk()}, ect}
}
\value{
Create template and pull skeleton for a stock assessment report.
Function builds a YAML specific to the region and utilizes current
resources and workflows from different U.S. Fishery Science Centers.
General sections are called as child documents in this skeleton and
each of the child documents should be edited separately.
}
\description{
To see templates included in the base skeleton, please run
'list.files(system.file('templates','skeleton', package = 'asar'))'
in the console.
