\arguments{
\item{new_template}{TRUE/FALSE; default is false otherwise if true, will pull the last saved stock assessment report skeleton}

\item{format}{File type for the render (i.e. pdf, docx, html)}

\item{office}{Regional fisheries science center producing the report (AFSC, NEFSC, NWFSC, PIFSC, SEFSC, SWFSC)}

\item{region}{Full name of region in which the species is evaluated if applicable; Note: if this is not specified for your center or for
the species, do not use this variable.}

\item{complex}{Is this a species complex? "YES" or "NO"}

\item{species}{Full common name for target species, split naming by a space and capitalize first letter(s)}

\item{spp_latin}{Latin name for the target species of this assessment}

\item{year}{Year the assessment is being conducted, default is current year report is being rendered}

\item{author}{List of authors to include in the assessment; keep authorship order}

\item{add_author}{temporarily add an author that is not currently in the database. Follow the format of "First MI Last".
Please leave a comment on the github issues page to be added.}

\item{include_affiliation}{TRUE/FALSE; does the analyst want to include affiliations of the authors in the document?}

\item{simple_affiliation}{If including affiliation, adding just office name rather than full address; TRUE/FALSE, default is TRUE}

\item{alt_title}{TRUE/FALSE create an alternative title than the default}

\item{title}{Name of new title if default is not appropriate; Example, "Management Track Assessments Spring 2024"}

\item{parameters}{TRUE/FALSE; default TRUE - for parameterization of the script}

\item{param_names}{List of parameter names that will be called in the document; parameters automatically included are office, region,
and species listed in function parameters}

\item{param_values}{List of values associated with the order of parameter names; parameters automatically included are office, region,
and species listed in function parameters}

\item{resdir}{Directory where the model results file(s) are located}

\item{model_results}{Name of the model results file}

\item{model}{Type of assessment model that was used to assess the stock (i.e. "BAM", "SS3", "AMAK", "ASAP", ect)}

\item{section_location}{Location where the section should be added relative to the base skeleton document}

\item{type}{Type of report to build - default is SAR}

\item{prev_year}{Year that previous assessment report was conducted in - for pulling previous assessment template}

\item{custom}{TRUE/FALSE Build custom sectioning for the template rather than the default for stock assessments in your region}

\item{custom_sections}{List of the sections you want to include in the custom template. Note: this only includes sections within
'templates' > 'skeleton'. The section name can be used such as 'abstract' rather than the entire name '00_abstract.qmd'.
If a new section is to be added, please also use parameters 'new_section', and 'section_location'}

\item{include_figures}{Determine if figures are included into the report}

\item{include_tables}{Indicate if tables are included into the report}

\item{add_image}{add outside image of species to the template}

\item{spp_image}{full directory and species image name to direct the program where to find and extract the image}
}
\value{
Create template and pull skeleton for a stock assessment report.
Function builds a YAML specific to the region and utilizes current
resources and workflows from different U.S. Fishery Science Centers.
General sections are called as child documents in this skeleton and
each of the child documents should be edited separately.
