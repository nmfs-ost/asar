\usage{
add_alttext(
  x = list.files(getwd())[grep("skeleton.tex", list.files(getwd()))],
  dir = getwd(),
  alttext_csv = file.path(getwd(), "captions_alt_text.csv"),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{.tex file containing report. Typically produced after initially
rendering the skeleton made from create_template.}

\item{dir}{directory where the tex file is located that will be edited}

\item{alttext_csv}{Directory for the csv file containing alternative
text and captions generated when running stockplotr::exp_all_figs_tables}

\item{compile}{Indicate whether the document (X) should be
rendered after these files are changed. Default TRUE.}

\item{rename}{Indicate a name for the new tex file produced from this
function. There is no need to include ".tex" in the name. Defaults to current
name and overwrites the current tex file.}

\item{tagged}{Indicate if the input tex file from dir has the latex package,
tagpdf, used so that tagging is present.}
}
\value{
This function was made to help add in
alternative text to latex documents generated from
quarto. Quarto does not currently contain a way to
add alternative text to PDF documents, so this function
was developed as a work around. The addition of alternative
text needs to be found in either the rda files produced from
stockplotr::exp_all_figs_tables or in the captions_alt_text.csv also produced from
the same function. Users not using this format should create a csv file with
columns containing "label" and "alt_text" where the label column contains the
exact label name when referencing the image/figure in text. The label is
very important as it provides a way for the function to match where the
alternative text gets placed. When compile is set to TRUE, the alternative
text using this format will not be available and must be used in conjunction
with \code{asar::add_tagging()} unless tagged is set to FALSE.
