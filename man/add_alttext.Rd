\title{Add alternative text into latex}
\usage{
add_alttext(
  x = list.files(getwd())[grep("skeleton.tex", list.files(getwd()))],
  dir = getwd(),
  rda_dir = getwd(),
  alttext_csv_dir = getwd(),
  compile = TRUE,
  rename = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{.tex file containing report. Typically produced after initially
rendering the skeleton made from create_template.}

\item{dir}{directory where the tex file is located that will be edited}

\item{rda_dir}{folder where rda files containing alternative text is located}

\item{alttext_csv_dir}{Directory for the csv file containing alternative
text and captions generated when running satf::exp_all_figs_tables}

\item{compile}{Indicate whether the document (X) should be
rendered after these files are changed. Default TRUE.}

\item{rename}{Indicate a name for the new tex file produced from this
function. There is no need to include ".tex" in the name. Defaults to current
name and overwrites the current tex file.}
}
\value{
This function was made to help add in
alternative text to latex documents generated from
quarto. Quarto does not currently contain a way to
add alternative text to PDF documents, so this function
was developed as a work around. The addition of alternative
text needs to be found in either the rda files produced from
satf::exp_all_figs_tables or in the captions_alt_text.csv also produced from
the same function. Users not using this format should create a csv file with
columns containing "label" and "alt_text".
