DRAFT: This function was made to help add in
alternative text to latex documents generated from
quarto. Quarto does not currently contain a way to
add alternative text to PDF documents, so this function
was developed as a work around. The addition of alternative
text needs to be in the form found in rda files made
from satf plotting functions. If users want to use this
function as a way to add alternative text to all
figures, please leave an issue to request this function.
