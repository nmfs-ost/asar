\arguments{
\item{output_file}{Assessment model output file (e.g., the
Report.sso file for SS3, the rdat file for BAM, etc.)}

\item{outdir}{Directory of the assessment model output file. Defaults to
working directory.}

\item{model}{Assessment model used in evaluation ("ss3", "bam",
"asap", "fims", "amak", "ms-java", "wham", "mas").}

\item{fleet_names}{Names of fleets in the assessment model as
shortened in the output file. If fleet names are not properly read, then
indicate the fleets names as an acronym in a vector}

\item{file_save}{TRUE/FALSE; Save the formatted object rather
than calling the function and adding the formatted object to
the global environment? Default is false.}

\item{savedir}{Directory to save the converted output file. Defaults to
working directory.}

\item{save_name}{Name of the converted output file (do not use
spaces).}

\value{
A reformatted and standardized version of assessment model results
for application in building a stock assessment reports and to easily
adapt results among regional assessments. The resulting object is
simply a transformed and machine readable version of a model output file.
There are 2 options for adding data to the function. (1) Add the full
path with the file name in output.file or (2) output.file is the file
name and outdir is the path to the file without a trailing forward slash.
