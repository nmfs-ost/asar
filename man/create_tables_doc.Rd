\usage{
create_tables_doc(subdir = NULL, include_all = TRUE, rda_dir = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{subdir}{subdirectory where the assessment report template is being stored}

\item{include_all}{include all default tables for a stock assessment report}

\item{rda_dir}{If the user has already created .rda files containing
figures, tables, alt text, and captions with \code{satf}, rda_dir represents
the location of the folder containing these .rda files ("rda_files").
Otherwise, if the user has not used \code{satf} to make those .rda files already,
those files will be generated automatically and placed within an "rda_files"
folder within rda_dir. The "rda_files" folder would have been
made with \code{satf::exp_all_figs_tables()}, or by exporting files by running individual
\code{satf} figure- and table-generating functions. If you have used \code{satf} to
generate these .rda files, you can leave the arguments below blank. NOTE:
If an "rda_files" folder is detected within rda_dir, .rda files will not be
regenerated.}
}
\value{
Create a quarto document as part of a stock assessment outline with
pre-loaded R chunk adding the stock assessment tables from the nmfs-ost/satf
R package. NOTE: If your table is too wide to print on a portrait-oriented page,
the page will be rotated to landscape view. If if is too wide to print in
landscape view, it will be split into multiple tables. In this case, a new rda
will be created and is identifiable by the phrase "split" in the filename (e.g.,
indices.abundance_table.rda will generate a new indices.abundance_table_split.rda
file). These tables will share the same caption.
