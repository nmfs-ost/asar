\usage{
create_tables_doc(subdir = NULL, include_all = TRUE, rda_dir = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{subdir}{subdirectory where the assessment report template is being stored}

\item{include_all}{include all default tables for a stock assessment report}
}
\value{
Create a quarto document as part of a stock assessment outline with
pre-loaded R chunk adding the stock assessment tables from the nmfs-ost/stockplotr
R package. NOTE: If your table is too wide to print on a portrait-oriented page,
the page will be rotated to landscape view. If if is too wide to print in
landscape view, it will be split into multiple tables. In this case, a new rda
will be created and is identifiable by the phrase "split" in the filename (e.g.,
indices.abundance_table.rda will generate a new indices.abundance_table_split.rda
file). These tables will share the same caption.
