\item{include_all}{include all default tables for a stock assessment report}

\item{rda_dir}{The location of the folder containing .rda files
("rda_files") already made with \code{satf}, or, if the user has not used
\code{satf} to make those .rda files already, rda_dir represents the location
that will contain .rda files in an "rda_files" folder. The folder would have
been made with \code{satf::exp_all_figs_tables()}, or by exporting files
by running individual \code{satf} figure- and table-generating functions.
If you have used \code{satf} to generate these .rda files, you can leave
the arguments below blank.}
