\usage{
create_tables_doc(subdir = getwd(), include_all = TRUE, rda_dir = getwd())
}
\arguments{
\item{subdir}{subdirectory where the assessment report template is being stored}

\item{include_all}{include all default tables for a stock assessment report}
}
\value{
Create a quarto document as part of a stock assessment outline with
pre-loaded R chunk adding the stock assessment tables from the nmfs-ost/stockplotr
R package. NOTE: If your table is too wide to print on a portrait-oriented page,
the page will be rotated to landscape view. If if is too wide to print in
landscape view, it will be split into multiple tables. In this case, a new rda
will be created and is identifiable by the phrase "split" in the filename (e.g.,
indices.abundance_table.rda will generate a new indices.abundance_table_split.rda
file), and column 1 will be repeated across split tables. These tables will
share the same caption. To specify a different repeated column(s), use
asar::export_split_tbls with your preferred essential_columns value.
