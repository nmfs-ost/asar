create_tables_doc(
  resdir = NULL,
  model_results = NULL,
  model = c("SS3", "BAM", "ASAP", "AMAK", "WHAM"),
  subdir = NULL,
  include_all = TRUE,

}
\arguments{
\item{resdir}{directory where the results file is located}

\item{model_results}{name of the results file of assessment output}

\item{model}{stock assessment model}

\item{subdir}{subdirectory where the assessment report template is being stored}

\item{include_all}{include all default tables for a stock assessment report}

\item{rda_dir}{If the user has already created .rda files containing
figures, tables, alt text, and captions with \code{satf}, rda_dir represents
the location of the folder containing these .rda files ("rda_files").
Otherwise, if the user has not used \code{satf} to make those .rda files already,
those files will be generated automatically and placed within the "report"
folder within the \code{file_dir}. The "rda_files" folder would have been
made with \code{satf::exp_all_figs_tables()}, or by exporting files by running individual
\code{satf} figure- and table-generating functions. If you have used \code{satf} to
generate these .rda files, you can leave the arguments below blank. NOTE:
If an "rda_files" folder is detected within rda_dir, .rda files will not be
regenerated.}
