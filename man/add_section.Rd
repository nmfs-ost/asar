\title{Add New Section or Subsection to Template}
\usage{
add_section(
  new_section = NULL,
  section_location = NULL,
  custom_sections = NULL,
  subdir = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{new_section}{Names of section(s) (e.g., introduction, results) or
subsection(s) (e.g., a section within the introduction) that will be
added to the document. Please make a short list if >1 section/subsection
will be added. The template will be created as a quarto document, added
into the skeleton, and saved for reference.}

\item{section_location}{Where new section(s)/subsection(s) will be added to
the skeleton template. Please use the notation of 'placement-section'.
For example, 'in-introduction' signifies that the new content would
be created as a child document and added into the 02_introduction.qmd.
To add >1 (sub)section, make the location a list corresponding to the
order of (sub)section names listed in the 'new_section' parameter.}

\item{custom_sections}{List of existing sections to include in
the custom template. Note: this only includes sections within
list.files(system.file("templates", "skeleton",
package = "asar")). The name of the section, rather than the
name of the file, can be used (e.g., 'abstract' rather than
'00_abstract.qmd'). If adding a new section, also use
parameters 'new_section' and 'section_location'.}

\item{subdir}{Directory where the new sections will be saved. In the
create_template function, this defaults to the location where the
template is saved.}
}
\value{
Add an additional section or subsection to the report template
if it is not already present in the default template. This provides
the option to add it as a section before or after an existing section,
or within a section as a child document.
