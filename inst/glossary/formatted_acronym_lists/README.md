# formatted_acronym_lists

This folder contains .csv files of council glossaries that were formatted sufficiently for import into R. Some glossaries required additional steps (manual formatting) before reaching this stage and are stored in the inst/glossary/raw_acronyms_lists folder.
This folder also contains a .csv file matching formal survey names ("Meaning") with informal survey names ("Acronym"). We hope that these entries will help users identify the correct names of surveys they wish to reference in their reports.
