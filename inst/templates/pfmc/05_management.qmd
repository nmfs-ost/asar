# Management 

## Reference Points

<!-- 1. Unfished spawning stock biomass, summary age biomass, and recruitment, along with unfished spawning stock output.  -->
<!-- 2. Reference points based on B40% for rockfish and round fish and on B25% for flatfish (spawning biomass and/or output, SPR, exploitation rate, equilibrium yield).  -->
<!-- 3.   Reference points based on default SPR proxy (spawning biomass and/or output, SPR, exploitation rate, equilibrium yield).  -->
<!-- 4. Reference points based on MSY (if estimated) (spawning biomass and/or output, SPR, exploitation rate, equilibrium yield).  -->
<!-- 5. Equilibrium yield curve showing various BMSY proxies.   -->

## Research and Data Needs

<!-- 1. Describe progress on Research and Data Needs items identified in the most recent previous stock assessment document and associated STAR panel report.  -->
<!-- 2. Describe new research and data needs and specify their priority (high, medium, low).  -->
