# Introduction {#sec-intro}

<!-- Scientific name, distribution, the basis for the choice of stock structure, including regional differences in life history or other biological characteristics that should form the basis of management units. A map showing the scope of the assessment and depicting boundaries for fisheries or data collection strata.  -->


## Life History

<!-- Important features of life history that affect management (e.g., migration, sexual dimorphism, bathymetric demography).   -->

## Ecosystem considerations

<!-- Ecosystem considerations that include relevant information on how environmental drivers, prey, competition, predation, and/or (habitat requirements/preferences may affect stock’s status, vital rates (growth, survival, productivity, recruitment), or range and distribution. Ecosystem considerations may also include how these factors, cross-FMP interactions with other fisheries and human social dynamics that may affect the stock (e.g., reliance and dependence by fishing communities, non-target species constraining harvest rates). The length and depth of this section will depend on availability of information from published studies and Integrated Ecosystem Assessment reports, expertise of the STAT, and whether ecosystem factors contribute quantitative information to the assessment. This is not required for an update assessment if a citation to the previous assessment is provided.  -->


## Fishery description

<!-- Important features of current fishery and relevant history of fishery.  -->

## Management History

<!---
Summary of management history (e.g., changes in mesh sizes, trip limits, or other management actions that may have significantly altered selection, catch rates, or discards). 
--->

## Management performance

<!-- Management performance, including a table or tables comparing Overfishing Limit (OFL), Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC), Annual Catch Limit (ACL), landings, and catch (i.e., landings plus discard) for each area and year. Groundfish assessments that estimate dead discarded catch must include a disclaimer noting that total mortality estimates from the WCGOP and from the stock assessment may differ due to the use of different methods. Investigation into how these methods differ is beyond the scope of a benchmark assessment. The rationale for modeling discard mortality can also be provided. This should be included in all update assessments.  -->

## Fisheries off Canada and Alaska

<!-- Description of fisheries for this species off Canada, Alaska and/or Mexico, including references to any recent assessments of those stocks extending beyond the Council’s jurisdiction. STATs are strongly encouraged to include a summary of catches and estimates of stock size and stock status for the most recent ten years if such information can be assembled without excessive difficulty. This is not required for an update assessment.    -->

<!-- See if AK has a more up to date assessment (MF) and add updated information on the Canada Assessment (IT) -->
