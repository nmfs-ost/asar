# Appendix 10b: VAST model-based abundance 

## Background

Model-based abundance indices have a long history of development in fisheries (Maunder and Punt 2004). 
We here use a delta-model that uses two linear predictors (and associated link functions) to model the probability of encounter and the expected distribution of catches (in biomass or numbers, depending upon the specific stock) given an encounter (Lo *et al*. 1992; Stefánsson 1996).  
Previous research has used spatial strata (either based on strata used in spatially stratified design, or post-stratification) to approximate spatial variation (Helser *et al*. 2004), although recent research suggests that accounting for spatial heterogeneity within a single stratum using spatially correlated residuals and habitat covariates can improve precision for the wrestling index (Shelton *et al*. 2014).  
Model-based indices have been used by the Pacific Fisheries Management Council to account for intra-class correlations among hauls from a single contract vessel since approximately 2004 (Helser *et al*. 2004).  
Specific methods evolved over time to account for strata with few samples (Thorson and Ward 2013), and eventually to improve precision based on spatial correlations (Thorson *et al*. 2015) using what became the Vector Autoregressive Spatio-temporal (VAST) model (Thorson and Barnett 2017).

The performance of VAST has been evaluated previously using a variety of designs.  
Research has showed improved performance estimating relative abundance compared with spatially-stratified index standardization models (Grüss and Thorson 2019; Thorson *et al*. 2015), while other simulation studies have shown unbiased estimates of abundance trends (Johnson *et al*. 2019).  
Brodie *et al*. (2020) showed improved performance in estimating index scale given simulated data relative to generalized additive and machine learning models.  
Using real-world case studies, Cao *et al*. (2017) showed how random variation in the placement of tows relative to high-quality habitat could be “controlled for” using a spatio-temporal framework, and OLeary *et al*. (2020) showed how combining surveys from the eastern and northern Bering Sea within a spatio-temporal framework could assimilate spatially unbalanced sampling in those regions. Other characteristics of model performance have also been simulation-tested although these results are not discussed further here.  

## Settings used in 2020

The software versions of dependent programs used to generate VAST estimates were:  

`R (>=3.5.3), INLA (18.07.12), TMB (1.7.15), TMBhelper (1.2.0), VAST (3.3.0),  FishStatsUtils (2.5.0), sumfish (3.1.22)`

We used a Poisson-link delta-model (Thorson 2018) involving two linear predictors, and a gamma distribution for the distribution of positive catch rates. 
We extrapolated catch density using 3705 m (2 nmi) X 3705 m (2 nmi) extrapolation-grid cells; this results in 36,690 extrapolation-grid cells for the eastern Bering Sea, 15,079 in the northern Bering Sea  and 26,510 for the Gulf of Alaska (some Gulf of Alaska analyses eliminated the deepest stratum with depths >700 m because of sparse observations, resulting in a 22,604-cell extrapolation grid). 
We used bilinear interpolation to interpolate densities from 500 “knots” to these extrapolation-grid cells (i.e, using `fine_scale=TRUE` feature); knots were distributed spatially in proportion to the distribution of extrapolation-grid cells (i.e., having an approximately even distribution across space) using `knot_method = 'grid'`. 
No temporal smoothing was used (i.e. variation was estimated using independent and identically distributed methods). 
We estimated “geometric anisotropy” (the tendency for correlations to decline faster in some cardinal directions than others), and included a spatial and spatio-temporal term for both linear predictors.  
Finally, we used epsilon bias-correction to correct for retransformation bias (Thorson and Kristensen 2016). 

### Diagnostics

For each model, we confirm that the Hessian matrix is positive definite and the gradient of the marginal likelihood with respect to each fixed effect is near zero (absolute value < 0.0001).  
We then conduct a visual inspection of the quantile-quantile plot for positive catch rates to confirm that it is approximately along the one-to-one line, and also check the frequency of encounters for data binned based on their predicted encounter probability (which again should be along the one-to-one line).  
Finally, we plot Pearson residuals spatially, to confirm that there is no residual pattern in positive and negative residuals.
