# Executive Summary {#sec-exec-sum}

<!--- Management Track Assessment TORs (Revised 02/22/2022)

1. Estimate catch from all sources including landings and discards.
2. Evaluate indices used in the assessment (e.g., indices of relative or absolute abundance,
recruitment, state surveys, age-length data, etc.).
3. Estimate annual fishing mortality, recruitment and stock biomass (both total and
spawning stock) as possible (depending on the assessment method) for the time series
using the approved assessment method and estimate their uncertainty. Include
retrospective analyses if possible (both historical and within-model) to allow a
comparison with previous assessment results and projections, and to examine model fit.
a. Include bridge runs to sequentially document each change from the previously
accepted model to the updated model proposed for this peer review.
b. Prepare a backup assessment approach that would serve as an alternative for
providing scientific advice to management if the analytical assessment were to not
pass review
4. Re-estimate or update the BRPâ€™s as defined by the management track level and
recommend stock status. Also, provide qualitative descriptions of stock status based
on simple indicators/metrics (e.g., age- and size-structure, temporal trends in
population size or recruitment indices, etc.).
5. Conduct short-term stock projections when appropriate.
6. Respond to any review panel comments or SSC concerns from the most recent prior
research or management track assessment.
