## Regional Workflows

NOAA Fisheries consists of six regional fishery science centers:

Alaska Fisheries Science Center

Northeast Fisheries Science Center

Northwest Fisheries Science Center

Pacific Islands Fisheries Science Center

Southeast Fisheries Science Center

Southwest Fisheries Science Center

Each office conducts fisheries stock assessments for species in their region and thus different process for evaluating stock status and reporting. Each region's process has been summarized in a NOAA technical memo (link when published)[].
