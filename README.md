Download using the directions below and fill in `create_template.R` function with 
the desired parameters (follow example below) to create a template Quarto document 
to be rendered to create a stock assessment report.

The goal of ASAR is to automate stock assessment reports for NOAA science centers
so they are reproducible and cohesive across the agency. This project intends 
to create a streamlined workflow that allows the analyst to create a customized 
report tailored to their needs and requirements by the SSC, council, or other 
regional management organizations. 

For users interested in testing, please see [Testing](#-testing-section) section below. 
In its current form, this package builds a  template to create a stock assessment report 
including NOAA Fisheries formatting and included tables and figures.

## Installation

First please check to make sure `tinytex` package is installed on your machine. If not, please install using the following lines:

```r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("rstudio/tinytex")
```

Then install the package using one of the three following ways:

(1) Using `pak`

```r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("nmfs-ost/asar")
```

(2) Using `remotes`

```r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("nmfs-ost/asar")
```

(3) From the nmfs-ost r-universe

```r
install.packages("asar", repos = c("https://nmfs-ost.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

We also recommend to download the [`stockplotr` package](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/stockplotr). Use one of the previous download instructions to also install `stockplotr` by replacing 'asar' with 'stockplotr'.

## Example

The following code will allow the user to replicate the [2023 petrale sole stock assessment](https://www.pcouncil.org/documents/2024/02/status-of-petrale-sole-eopsetta-jordanialong-the-u-s-west-coast-in-2023.pdf/) 
produced by the NWFSC and made available by the Pacific Fisheries Management Council. 
The assessment model files are also available on the PFMC's website. A tutorial 
for using `asar` can be found [here](https://connect.fisheries.noaa.gov/asar_tutorial/).

The SS3 Report.sso files was converted using the following code:

```r
output <- asar::convert_output(
  file = system.file("extdata", "Report.sso", package = "asar"),
  model = "ss3",
  save_dir = here::here("readme_output.rda"))
```

In this function, the users have the option to convert output files to a standardized 
framework from either SS3 (Report.sso) or BAM (.rdat) output files. `asar` uses this 
converted output from the environment to calculate quantities in the preamble and 
it is also used for creating plots and tables from [`stockplotr`](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/stockplotr).

To proceed, the user should then run the following:

```r
asar::create_template(
  format = "pdf",
  office = "NWFSC",
  region = "U.S. West Coast",
  species = "Petrale sole",
  spp_latin = "Eopsetta jordani",
  year = 2023,
  author = c("Ian G. Taylor"="NWFSC", "Vladlena Gertseva"="NWFSC", "Nick Tolimieri"="NWFSC"),
  include_affiliation = TRUE,
  simple_affiliation = FALSE,
  param_names = c("nf","sf"),
  param_values = c("North fleet", "South fleet"),
  model_results = here::here("readme_output.rda")
)
```

Note: The output of this report is an example based on a real stock assessment. Please refer to the link in the beginning of this section for the full assessment report. 

## Testing

We encourage users to test `asar` throughout its development. Please use the above example to get a basic understanding on how to create a stock assessment template. **Currently, `asar` is only setup to render to a pdf or html.** Once the user successfully executes `create_template()`, all files are created and the user can render the document from the skeleton file:

![](man/figures/example_pop-up.PNG){alt="A basic skeleton produced by asar displaying the beginning of the quarto document called the yaml. The image shows the title, author, and other important formatting arguments to render a quarto document."}

All associated files will be created in a folder called `report` within the `file_dir` argument path (default working directory).

![](man/figures/example_file_system.PNG){alt="A screenshot of a file explorer showing the outline of quarto documents produced when running create template function from a.s.a.r. There are 15 quarto documents, a bib file, a glossary latex file, and a folder containing support files that dictate report format."}

This is a modularized template, there is no need to make any edits to the skeleton file. To write the report, user should navigate and open each supporting section Quarto document labeled:

-   Executive Summary
-   Introduction
-   Data
-   Assessment
-   Discussion
-   Acknowledgments
-   References
-   Tables
-   Figures 
-   Appendix

## User Community

This package is intended for use by stock assessment analysts across NOAA Fisheries, but the modularized process and workflow can be used in other applications such as developing other reports for managing organizations or for rendering stock assessment reports in other regions of the world.

Feel free to report any issues with the package to the [GitHub Issues Page](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/asar/issues) and any questions regarding the package on the [GitHub discussion board](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/asar/discussions). Before you create an issue, please see the status at the beginning of this page to check if the package is operational or still in early stages of development.
