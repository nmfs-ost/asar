# Contributing to `asar`

Do you have an idea that would improve `asar`? *Consider making a contribution!* We welcome ideas for improving not only our code, but also our documentation, tutorial, and any other material associated with `asar`. Here are some options and tips for doing so.

Note: To make any contribution, you must agree to abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/asar/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Contributing ideas: code, documentation, etc.

### Recommended workflow: fork & submit a pull request

The most efficient way to contribute an idea is to fork `asar`, make your suggested changes on a local branch, and then submit a pull request. This will allow the developers to easily evaluate your suggested changes. Please see the [GitHub Docs' "Contributing to a project" page](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project) for step-by-step guidance in using this workflow.

### Recommended practices

-   Write clear, succinct commit messages ([see some tips here](https://opensource.com/article/22/12/git-commit-message))
-   Limit a commit to a few, rather than many, changes. Smaller commits means more commit messages, which is often helpful for documentation.
-   Ensure your base branch is correct. We typically merge most PRs into "dev", then merge "dev" into "main" upon a new release.
-   Test that your contributed code will function as expected under different circumstances.
-   Add comments to the code if it's not immediately clear what the purpose of the code is, or how it works.

## Contributing bugs

Found a bug? Tell us about it on our [Issues page](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/asar/issues). Before you create an issue, please check that it has not already been resolved (i.e., is a "closed" issue) or documented in our [Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) vignette](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/asar/articles/faqs.html).

If possible, please submit a reproducible example ([reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/articles/reprex-dos-and-donts.html)) to help us understand the problem better and, ideally, allow us to reproduce your issue.
