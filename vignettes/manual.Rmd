## Navigation

The overarching function to create or pull a stock assessment report template is `create_template()`. This is the first function the analyst will call to develop a stock assessment report. This step comes after running the stock assessment model and performing necessary diagnostics.

## Workflow

Here will be the location for the workflow and navigation of using this R package.

### Editing Captions and Alternative Text

After generating your Figures and Tables .qmd files, there will be pre-generated captions for your figures and tables, and alternative text for your figures. Please be sure to double-check that these captions and alternative text are 1) accurate and 2) complete. To learn how to edit and update these elements, please refer to [the accessibility vignette's guide ](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/asar/articles/accessibility_guide.html#how-to-edit-your-reports-alt-text-and-captions).
