## Markdown Notation

Efficiently using this package in the stock assessment workflow requires a basic understanding of markdown notation. In this article, we are going to describe common notation and example using markdown language in which you might use for writing a stock assessment report.

## Summary

### Basic Syntax 

| Element | Markdown Syntax |
|---------|-----------------|
| Heading | # H1 <br> ## H2 <br> ### H3|
| **Bold** | ```` **bold text** ```` |
| *Italic* | ```` *italic* ```` |
| ***Bold & italic*** | ```` *** bold italic*** ```` |
| Blockquote | > blockquote |
| Ordered list | 1. Item #1 <br> 2. Item #2 <br> 3. Item #3 |
| Unordered list | - Item #1 <br> - Item #2 <br> - Item #3 |
| Code | ```` `code` ```` |
| R code chunk |```` ```{r} <br> ``` ```` |
| Horizantal rule | --- |
| Link | ```` [Text](https://www.example.com) ```` |
| Image | ```` ![caption](path/image.jpg) ```` |
| Image in code chunk | `knitr::include_graphics("path/image.png") |

### Extended Syntax

| Element | Markdown Syntax |
|---------|-----------------|
| Markdown table | \| Syntax \| Description \| <br>  \|----------\|-------\| <br> \| first entry \| definition \| <br> \| entry 2 \| decription \| |
| Footnote | Sentence with a footnote. [^1] <br> [^1]: This is footnote. |
| Heading Labels | ### Heading A {#sec-nameA} |
| Reference heading label | ````@sec-nameA ```` |
| Strikethrough | ````~~Strikethrough~~```` |
| Task list | - [x] Task a <br> - [ ] task b <br> - [ ] task c |
| Highlight | I want to ==highlight this part== of the sentence. |
| Subscript | ````F~msy~```` |
| Superscript | ````X^2^```` |
| Comment out text | ````<!--- text here ---```` |
| in text email or URLs | ````<www.example.com>```` <br> ````<example@noaa.gov>````` |

## Markdown Syntax

### Code Chunks {#sec-codechunk}

In order to add a piece of code into the text directly encase R code within a pair of back ticks (`). For example:

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
#| eval: false

params$region
```


The above example shows how one would incorporate the *region* parameter into a sentence in a markdown or quarto file. In google docs, this notation formatted to green and the font roboto mono.

If we define the parameter of region as NWFSC, the result would render as `r params$region`

Other ways to incorporate markdown notation include:

  - in-line calculations: \`r 2+2` 
  resulting in `r 2+2`
  
### References

`asar` comes with a default .bib file which contains example refereces, but users are encouraged to replace it or expand upon it with their own .bib files for references in their report. To references an article or other referenes from the file within the test use the following notation

Notation -- The dynasty fell within the year 1206 leaving the vikings in a state of unrest (````@Biddle_1992````).

Result -- The dynasty fell within the year 1206 leaving the vikings in a state of unrest (@Biddle_1992).

The citation will properly format according to APA standards and include the citation in `07_references.qmd`. A good rule of thumb to follow is that references are cited use the @ symbol followed by the first author's last name then the publication year. This is not always the case, so it is advised that users check their bib file for the proper citation or use the Visual editor that provides a convenient drop down with a list of suggested citations base on author name, year, or keyword from the title.
  
### Combinations

A lot of the notation in this document can be combined for a highly customizable document. For example, you can bold or italicize a link by surrounding the notation to insert a link by astrics:

Notation -- ````*[NOAA Fisheries](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/)*````

Results -- *[NOAA Fisheries](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/)*
