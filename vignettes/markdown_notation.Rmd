# Markdown Notation

Efficiently using this package in the stock assessment workflow requires a basic understanding of markdown notation. In this article, we are going to describe common notation and example using markdown language in which you might use for writing a stock assessment report.

## Summary

### Basic Syntax 

| Element | Markdown Syntax |
|---------|-----------------|
| Heading | # H1 <br> ## H2 <br> ### H3|
| **Bold** | ```` **bold text** ```` |
| *Italic* | ```` *italic* ```` |
| ***Bold & italic*** | ```` *** bold italic*** ```` |
| Blockquote | > blockquote |
| Ordered list | 1. Item #1 <br> 2. Item #2 <br> 3. Item #3 |
| Unordered list | - Item #1 <br> - Item #2 <br> - Item #3 |
| Code | ```` `code` ```` |
| R code chunk |```` ```{r} <br> ``` ```` |
| Horizontal rule | --- |
| Link | ```` [Text](https://www.example.com) ```` |
| Image | ```` ![caption](path/image.jpg) ```` |
| Image in code chunk | `knitr::include_graphics("path/image.png") |

### Extended Syntax

| Element | Markdown Syntax |
|---------|-----------------|
| Markdown table | \| Syntax \| Description \| <br>  \|----------\|-------\| <br> \| entry 1 \| description \| <br> \| entry 2 \| description \| |
| Footnote | Sentence with a footnote. [^1] <br> [^1]: This is a footnote. |
| Heading Labels | ### Heading A {#sec-nameA} |
| Reference heading label | ````@sec-nameA ```` |
| Strikethrough | ````~~Strikethrough~~```` |
| Task list | - [x] Task a <br> - [ ] task b <br> - [ ] task c |
| Subscript | ````F~msy~```` |
| Superscript | ````X^2^```` |
| Comment out text | ````<!--- text here ---```` |
| in-text email or URLs | ````<www.example.com>```` <br> ````<example@noaa.gov>````` |

## Markdown Syntax

### Code Chunks {#sec-codechunk}

To add a piece of code into the text directly, encase R code within a pair of back ticks (\`). For example, \`params$region` will render like this:

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| code-summary: "Show the code"
#| eval: false

params$region
```


The above example shows how one would incorporate the *region* parameter into a sentence in a markdown or quarto file. In google docs, this notation formatted to green and the font roboto mono.

If we define the parameter of region as NWFSC, the phrase "my region is  \`params\$region\` would render as  "my region is `r params$region`".

Other ways to incorporate markdown notation include:

#### In-line calculations

  - `\r 2+2\` would render as `r 2+2`.
  
### References

`asar` comes with a default .bib file which contains example references, but users are encouraged to replace it or expand upon it with their own .bib files for references in their report. To references an article or other references from the file within the test use the following notation:

> "The dynasty fell within the year 1206, leaving the Vikings in a state of unrest (````@Biddle_1992````)."

renders as

> "The dynasty fell within the year 1206, leaving the Vikings in a state of unrest (@Biddle_1992)."

The citation will properly format according to APA standards and include the citation in `07_references.qmd`. A good rule of thumb to follow is that references are cited use the @ symbol followed by the first author's last name then the publication year. This is not always the case, so it is advised that users check their bib file for the proper citation or use the Visual editor that provides a convenient drop down with a list of suggested citations base on author name, year, or keyword from the title.
  
### Combinations

A lot of the notation in this document can be combined for a highly customizable document. For example, you can bold or italicize a link by surrounding the notation to insert a link by asterisks (\*):

#### Italicized link

\*\[NOAA Fisheries]\(https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov)* renders as *[NOAA Fisheries](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/)*

#### Bolded link

\*\*\[NOAA Fisheries]\(https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov)** renders as **[NOAA Fisheries](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/)**
