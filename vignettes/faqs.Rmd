# Installing `asar`

## How can I download the package?

Our README page provides a lot of basic directions to prepare you to successfully download the package. Please consult the page for downloading. In the case you are having troubles downloading, and receiving the following error:

```         
Using GitHub PAT from the git credential store.
Initiating curl with CURL_SSL_BACKEND: openssl
Error: Failed to install 'unknown package' from GitHub:
  HTTP error 403.
  Resource protected by organization SAML enforcement. You must grant your OAuth token access to this organization.
```

Please download the package using this code:

```         
install.packages("asar", repos = c("https://nmfs-ost.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"))
```

# Setting up the report skeleton

## create_template isn't working. What do I do?

This could mean a lot of things. Most of the time, when create_template is not working, it means you are missing a key argument to the function. Make sure to read the error message(s) clearly and check the 'report' folder where all of the file were created. If you have exhausted your options and double checked that you have all of the correct arguments, then please leave an [issue](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/asar/issues).

## What should I do if I have a species complex/multispecies assessment?

`asar` was not developed with the intention to use it for multiple species in one go. While in testing, users have simply combined the species using "and" in the species argument of create_template. The report can be written as desired after the fact. The beauty of asar is that it is still a template and highly customizable. User's familiar with Quarto can make edits to the YAML, chunk options, and other important components controlling the production of the document. We highly discourage making changes to the formatting or adding large additions of sections to the document that stray too far from the intended "NOAA" formatting.

# Editing reports

## How do I reference one of the quantities in the preamble in my text?

You can use the quantities in the preamble to make dynamic reports that can easily be changed within the text by changing the output file. To reference these quantities in your text please use the following notation:

```{verbatim}
`r Fend`
```

For more help with using quarto (and using it efficiently), please see our [markdown guide](markdown_notation.html) to learn the in's and out's of writing a stock assessment report in quarto.

## How can I edit my report's alt text and captions?

Please refer to [the accessibility vignette's guide ](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/asar/articles/accessibility_guide.html#how-to-edit-your-reports-alt-text-and-captions) on editing alt text and captions.

## How can I use acronyms and edit the glossary?

Please refer to the [Acronyms and Glossary section of the accessibility vignette](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/asar/articles/accessibility_guide.html#acronyms-and-glossary) for guidance on how to use acronyms and edit the glossary.

## What is this R chunk in the the skeleton file labelled `output_and_quantities` used for?

This chunk is what we call the preamble. It loads in commonly used estimates and quantities for the user to reference throughout their report. The calculation of these values can be found in the `preamble.R` script found within your report folder.

# Tables and Figures

## Why aren't my tables and/or figures displaying on landscape-oriented pages when the landscape braces are present?

You may be using a version of Quarto [older than v1.6](https://quarto.org/docs/blog/posts/2024-11-25-1.6-release/). Please read [this Discussion post](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/asar/discussions/186) detailing how to check which version you have and update it.

## My figure and table references aren't in chronological order in the report. How do I fix this?

You will notice that the order of your figures and tables in their respective 08_tables.qmd and 09_figures.qmd docs will determine their numbers in the report. This might result in Table 2 being referenced before Table 1, for instance, in your report.

We are encouraging users to keep the order as-is for a few reasons. First, the predictability of standardized figure and table order could prove useful when comparing reports. Second, the choice of where to prioritize the figure/table order- in the Figures and Tables sections, or in the main text- is somewhat of a personal preference, rather than a hard rule. Third, as far as we know, a fix isn't yet possible with Quarto. We are choosing to focus on building other features for `asar`.

However, we understand that some will strongly prefer to set the order of their tables and figures. You *can* try manually changing the order of the figure and table chunks in the 08_tables.qmd and 09_figures.qmd docs, but this isn't a reproducible or permanent solution.

## Why are there absolute, rather than relative, filepaths for `tables_dir` and `figures_dir` at the tops of my figures and tables docs?

We tried to implement relative filepaths for these objects but decided to return to the original workflow for two reasons.

1. Hardcoding `getwd()` into the path doesn't work; when rendering your report, Quarto will recognize your "report" folder as the working directory, which probably isn't your *actual* working directory. This will result in a rendering error.

2. While hardcoding `here::here()` into the path *does* work, we recognize that some users may be unfamiliar with [the `here` package](https://here.r-lib.org/) and are not able to learn another tool while already learning `asar`. We highly recommend checking out this awesome package, but in the meantime, we are not going to force its use.

If you want to ensure `tables_dir` and `figures_dir` are relative filepaths (which may be essential if you are collaborating), you can directly edit these paths yourself and reset them using `getwd()`, `here::here()`, or some other option.

# Rendering reports

## Why am I getting the following error message when I try to render my template?:

``` error:
compilation failed- error
LaTeX Error: Something's wrong--perhaps a missing \item.

See the LaTeX manual or LaTeX Companion for explanation.
Type  H <return>  for immediate help.
 ...                                              
                                                  
l.419 \end{CSLReferences}
```

The above error message is created due to a bug introduced in Quarto in the last year where the notation in *07_references.qmd* creates an issue when there is no in-text reference in the text. To correct this, please add this sentence temporarily to any of the quarto files in the outlined document (*only if you are using the default asar_references.bib file*):

`Here is an example of an in text citation (@methot_stock_2013).`

## When rendering, why does my report hang on the figures doc?

When rendering your report, it may hang when processing the figures file. If this occurs, it probably means that your tinytex installation isn't working properly. This may occur even if you've installed the TinyTeX bundle with every LaTeX package you could install from CTAN ([TinyTeX-2](https://github.com/rstudio/tinytex-releases?tab=readme-ov-file#releases)).

Try this: Uninstall tinytex (`tinytex::uninstall_tinytex()`), then reinstall it in the terminal (`quarto install tinytex`).

Notably, this command will install TinyTeX-1 bundle (the default), then install the necessary LaTeX packages needed for rendering *while your report is rendering the first time*. 

# General errors

## I'm getting an error. How do I fix it?

When getting to know `asar`, you'll probably encounter some errors. We highly recommend checking out our [Issues page](https://github.com/nmfs-ost/asar/issues) to see if someone else has already asked (and maybe solved!) your question.
